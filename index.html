  <main><h2>Welcome to Let's Travel The World!</h2><p>By traveling - both within the USA and abroad - we expand our horizons and gain a greater appreciation of the world we live in.
    <br>
Experiencing other cultures, including new food, languages, and customs, challenges us and makes us better understand our own culture.
    <br>
We are a full service travel agency. As seasoned travelers ourselves, we know what we're talking about and can draw upon our own experiences when putting together a great adventure for you and your family.
    <br>
Once you've enjoyed a couple of great trips, you might just "catch the bug" like we did and start planning two or three trips ahead! Maybe you'll even put a big world map up on your wall at home and get out the color pushpins...
    <br>
So contact us today and let's start planning your next amazing trip!</p></main>
